This is a little merb app that serves as an openid provider.  The rails provider
app inside of the ruby-openid gem is dated and has 0 specs.  I needed one at work
today and it seemed best to learn the code by specing as I go.  This works w/
merb 1.0.

Requirements (UNIX)
-------------------
% script/update

On Localhost
------------
% script/merb -p 4001
To connect to this you're going to need a user, we can't register them yet though. :\
Have your browser redirect to http://localhost:4001/users/:id
The development environment has a user 'atmoose' 
  with email 'atmoose@atmos.com' 
  with password 'foo' 
  it's useful for testing clients
  
A client should hit 'http://localhost:4001/users/atmoose
