This is a little merb app that serves as an openid provider.  The rails provider
app inside of the ruby-openid gem is dated and has 0 specs.  I needed one at work
today and it seemed best to learn the code by specing as I go.  This works w/
merb 0.9.10.

Requirements
------------
% sudo gem install merb ruby-openid rr rspec
